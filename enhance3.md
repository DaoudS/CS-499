#Artifact Description
This artifact was a project submitted during my CS:340 Client/Server Development class during term 21EW1. It consisted of a mongoDB database that was modified only using a python script that performed crud operation on the database. We also created a jupyter notebook that made use of the scripts that we had created and produced a dashboard that further utilized said scripts. 

#Justification for Inclusion
I wanted to include this artifact because being able to accomplish this feat, demonstrated my ability to interact with a given database and generate data that is both customizable and adaptable to the needs of the user requesting the data. I also felt that it was one of the clearer examples of database-based projects that I had worked on during my time thus far at SNHU. It was also a project that was not fully complete when I had originally submitted in the last term. Though I had spent more than 15 plus hours on it, there were some aspects that I was unable to complete. Using it for this enhancement allowed me to go back and complete them while also completing my enhancement goals. A two for one sort of deal. 

#Reflect
To reach my goal of increasing the complexity of the code submitted, I made use of additional Dash components to allow user manipulation of that data being displayed on the dashboard. This was accomplished via the implementation of a new bar chart that allows the users to modify. Comments were refined, add, and or deleted as necessary to remove anything extra. I also made use of the docstrings functionality that python provides to make the purpose of methods and classes clearer. I of course brought the naming conventions of the various items within the code up to python standards. 
During the process of the enhancement, I found myself struggling with some of the same issues I had encountered when I had originally worked in this project. Most notably was getting the radio items, or the selection options at the top of the data table working. I required me to spend a lot more time with the Dash documentation and watching examples that youtubers provided. Similar issues were found when I added more dash components to the project, as these were items, I had no previous experience with. They did however further enhance my ability to work with the documentation frameworks provided. Though, Iâ€™m sure future projects may have me working with frameworks that have little if any documentation to go off.
