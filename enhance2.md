#Artifact Description
This was a project consisting of java code submitted in project two of my  IT-145: Foundation in Application class during term 20EW5.

#Justification for Inclusion
I decided to include this artifact because I felt that my understanding of the original intentions of the project and the codebase at its current point would be very helpful in my ability to modify the project and bring it up to standards that are more in line with my current ability. Not too far off from the previous project I submitted, this project showcased my ability to take a program that was not designed in a modular manner or not for use by the programs and turn it into just that. I took inspiration from my previous project as it was also a project that was originally done in Java. 

#Reflect

I was able to complete and flesh out the rest of the services specified in the code base. Before this project they had been left with the output of not yet implemented when selected. Also added classes that were extensions of a primary class just too practice develop my ability to work with class inheritance.
I do think that I was able to meet the goal that I had set in module one about the intent for these enhancements. Some enhancements I made were not even identified until I was able to start programming in delve more deeply into the workings of the code. One of the smaller things I learned while developing this codebase was that one kid separate the scope a variable in switch statements by using curly braces. Now that does sound like a simple thing to understand it and it is but, it wasn't something I needed to know until working on this codebase. Like any other project it forced me to become more familiar with the troubleshooting tools provided by the software I was using at the time. In this case that was VScode. I think one of the larger challenges I faced was not so much with the code but more with myself. Fatigue found me struggling to troubleshoot some portions of the codebase because I was overlooking variable references or method calls. It was sort of a friendly reminder to me that resident corporation is just as important as anything else will developing.
