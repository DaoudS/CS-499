#Artifact Description
The project originates from my CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance class. Its focus was on creating a number of services that revolved on new objects and types that we would create. The service code that we wrote focused on manipulation attributes of hte object not too dissimilar to crud operations. It was create during term 21EW6.

#Justification for Inclusion
This artifact was included as it demonstrates at a base level my understanding of use cases for practical unit tests applied to a development project. More than anything it shows my ability to understand abstract object oriented programming techniques and my ability to make use of varying frameworks to produce the same outcome across languages. 



#Reflect
Throughout the transformation of the code into the new language, I most definitely became more familiar with visual studios and the tools it offers developers when it comes to making unit tests. I found the interface and documentation for the uses of MSTest to be efficiently presented and in abundance. Interest, I was also able to see a lot of the mistakes I had made in the original Java project. Whether that was simple spelling mistakes, or the use of wrong methods or completely unnecessary lines of code. Truthfully the most challenging part was working through the syntax of functions that are similar in C# but not quite the same in java. I imagine I would have had a more challenging time had I chosen languages that were not so closely related and similarly designed. 

Throughout the conversion of the code from Java to C# I made fine edits into the various lines of code. I ensure that during the reconstruction all naming conventions and standards were adhered to for the new code base as it was severely lacking in the Java project. I also made use of extensive use of document strings and the like to ensure that users always understood what the purpose of my classes and methods were. I left none of these items ambiguous in their function or purpose. I also tried to cut down on unnecessary lines of code. Mainly variable that were created but never referenced, ensuring variables that need not be access by outside classes are private and ensuring that excess space was removed.

I do think that I met my original goals set forth in my initial description from module one. Though I did somewhat reduce my original intention in scope. The project as it was in java consisted of three or so smaller projects where I was creating an item and an item service. Take for example Contact and ContactService. There were two others just like and after having converted all of them, I did not think it necessary to create unit tests for all six files know that they all did the same thing with a very slight deviation.
